## Projects

Hangman Game

This project is a C++ implementation of the classic game Hangman. The objective of the game is for the player to guess a secret word chosen by the computer, letter by letter, before a certain number of incorrect guesses are made. The game provides the player with a limited number of attempts to guess the word, and for each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure (the "hangman") is drawn. The game ends either when the player guesses the word correctly or when the entire hangman is drawn, indicating a loss.

The project includes features such as randomly selecting a word from a list of words, keeping track of the player's progress, displaying the hangman graphic, and allowing the player to input their guesses. The program also provides hints to the player by showing the number of letters in the word and the letters that have already been guessed correctly.

Overall, this project demonstrates a practical application of C++ programming concepts, input/output operations, string manipulation, and algorithmic logic.


Casion Game

This project is a C++ implementation of a simple casino game where the player bets a certain amount of money and guesses a number between 1 and 10. If the player's guess matches the randomly generated number, they win the amount they bet; otherwise, they lose their bet.

The game includes features such as allowing the player to input their bet amount and guess, generating a random number between 1 and 10, and displaying the result of the game, including the amount won or lost.

Overall, this project demonstrates a practical application of C++ programming concepts, including input/output operations, conditional statements, random number generation, and provides a simple and engaging game for players to enjoy.
